            <h2>Custom iOS Apps</h2>
            <p>
              We design and develop custom applications for Apple iOS
              devices such as iPhone and iPad and connect them to your
              existing back end services or we build those services
              for you.  We uniquely combine skills in iOS application
              development with years of industrial experience in
              server side development, understanding issues of
              scalability, availability, and security.  This allows us
              to provide you with a well engineered end-to-end
              solution including a high quality mobile iOS application
              which integrates well into your existing IT landscape.

            <h2>Back End Services</h2>
            <p>
              Most non-trivial mobile applications connect to some
              back end services or have to integrate into existing IT
              landscapes.  In order for an iOS application to work
              well, it has to be designed and implemented with the
              integration of the back end services from the very
              start. We understand well the complexities of networking
              and distributed computing and know how to engineer
              robust, well behaved mobile applications and scalable,
              highly available and secure back end services.

                distributed computing and Play framework which is

            <p> 
              We work closely with you throughout the whole project
              life cycle employing agile development methodologies and
              state of the art tools.  We believe that the continuous
              involvement of the client representative in the project
              is very necessary for its success.

              Using agile methodologies like Scrum, Kanban, continuous
              integration to name a few, guaranteeing complete
              transparency about the project status, progress, open
              issues and risks, we ensure that the client is in
              control at all times and can influence the features and
              their implementation almost to the end of the
              development process.  The agile development
              methodologies allow us to react well to any change in
              requirements and priorities while still assuring high
              quality of the implementation.

              We can host the entire project development on our
              innovative private cloud based platform Pirakoko, which
              provides all the features successfully used in modern
              software development in one place: like Git version
              control (including GitHub integration), issue and bug
              tracking, project news and wikis, kanban boards,
              continuous build and integration using Hudson/Jenkins

              real time collaborative editing, debugging and testing
              sessions and much more.  If you would be interested to
              use Pirakoko cloud service instead of your in house
              software development infrastructure, we would be very
              happy to discuss it with you and demo it to you.

              his last employer Sun Microsystems and was involved in a
              number of Java, Java EE, Jini, security, identity and
              access management projects. Among them he delivered a
              tax processing system for the Portuguese government, led
              a Sun internal research project on metadata search
              engine using semantic web technologies and was a member

              technology for over 12 years now.  He is passionate
              about increasing quality by reducing complexity because
              a line of code which is not there cannot introduce new
              bugs.

              things. He always promotes simpler solutions that work
